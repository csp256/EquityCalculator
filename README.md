This calculator is for computing growth of real estate equity with leverage.

It ignores cashflows from the financed asset, but assumes that the cashflow pays for all costs, including financing.

It only tracks equity from appreciation and principal paydown.

This obviates the benefit of exploiting low down payment owner occupant financing for investment purposes, aka "house hacking".
